# Assignment_53

## Description
This project contains a set of **generic (template-based) C++ programs**
that perform common operations on arrays.  
All programs are implemented using **C++ templates**, allowing the same
logic to work with multiple data types such as **int, float, and double**.

---

## Programs Included

### 1 Copy One Array into Another
Copies all elements from one array into another array of the same size.

### 2 Check Whether Array Is Sorted
Checks whether the given array is sorted in **ascending order**.

### 3 Find Second Largest Element
Finds the **second largest distinct element** from the array using
single traversal logic.

### 4️ Find Second Smallest Element
Finds the **second smallest distinct element** from the array using
single traversal logic.

### 5️ Replace All Occurrences of a Value
Replaces all occurrences of a specified value in the array with
a new value.

---

## Concepts Used
- Generic Programming using Templates
- Arrays
- Looping Statements
- Conditional Logic
- Function Reusability

---

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for all programs
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (constant extra space)

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
g++ Filename.cpp
./a.out
(Use the same command for other program files by changing the file name)
```
