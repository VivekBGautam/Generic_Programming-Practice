# Generic Programming Assignments (C++)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a curated set of generic programming assignments implemented in C++ using templates. The objective of these assignments is to demonstrate type-independent, reusable, and efficient programming techniques, which are essential for writing scalable and maintainable software.

### 🎯 Objectives

Understand and apply C++ templates

Write type-safe and reusable code

Strengthen problem-solving and logic-building skills

Learn industry-relevant generic programming practices

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts:

Function Templates

Generic Data Handling

Compile-time Polymorphism

Standard I/O

### 📂 Project Structure

Each source file represents an independent generic assignment demonstrating a specific programming concept.

### 🧠 Assignment Highlights

Generic multiplication of numbers

Generic array copy operations

Sorted array verification

Type-independent logic implementation

Clean, readable, and reusable code structure

### ▶️ How to Compile and Run

Use any standard C++ compiler such as g++.

g++ program53_1.cpp -o output
./output

### 📈 Learning Outcomes

After completing these assignments, you will be able to:

Design reusable C++ functions using templates

Reduce code duplication

Write clean and maintainable generic logic

Apply theoretical concepts in practical programs

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

Add generic data structures (Stack, Queue, Linked List)

Use STL with templates

Include test cases

Improve documentation with examples
